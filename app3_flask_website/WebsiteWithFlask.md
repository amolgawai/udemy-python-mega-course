# Build a Website with Flask
Build a basic Web app/static website with flask.


## Interesting Modules
- [Flask - web development with python](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)

## Observations
- Very basic introduction to flask
- A lot of emphasis on deployment to heroku
- For the first time git and virtual environments are mentioned and that too because heroku enforces the same.
