# Booshop Database App
Build a desktop GUI bookstore app that has books information such as title, author, year and ISBN

## Interesting Modules
- sqlite3 - for the database
- tkinter - fir the GUI

## Observations
On MacOS, if python is installed using homebrew or pyenv, tkinter is not available. In this case, the system default python may be used which generally is Python 2. The rest of the codebase here is Python 3
